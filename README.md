## changes from OG game
* the plan is to not have regular IV or EV to save storage space
    - Insted have a vslue between 1-5 where 1 = worst IV and 5 = perfect IV
    - EV will start at 0, after defeeting (maybe) 10 pokemon it will increes by 1. Where 1 EV = 100 EV point on ALL stats. 
* things like EV progression and EXP progression will resett when closing. aka, if you level up or EV up and save, it will be saved. But if you deffeat 9 pokemons without level/EV up and save, you have to deffeat 9 pokemons again to have the same progression.
